In worlds of code and pixels bright, A realm of Virtual Reality takes flight, A place where dreams and visions unite, And reality bends to a new sight.

A place where dreams and codes converge, Lies a realm of infinite possibility, Where Virtual Reality games emerge.

From the depths of the human mind, A new reality is designed, A place where we can leave behind, The limits of our physical kind.

We soar through skies and swim with sharks, As we explore this new frontier, Our senses heightened, our spirits free, As we conquer every fear.

And when the game is finally done, We leave with heavy hearts,  Knowing we'll return another day, To this world where magic starts.

In Virtual Reality, we can be, Anything we ever wanted to see, We can soar high and explore free, And live out our fantasies.

But as we journey through this land, We must remember to understand, That Virtual Reality is a strand, Of the world we hold in our hand.

For though it may be digital and unreal, It can affect how we think and feel, And in our minds, it can reveal, New possibilities we can seal.
